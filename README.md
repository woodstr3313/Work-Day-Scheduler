# Work-Day-Scheduler
This application was created for users to set up a weekly schedule. I updated the Javascript file to allow users to save their entries the appropriate way when blocking off time. I first added comments to my javascript file and then started out by running a console.log to see what was happening on the page. I then created a variable for my button to function as an on/off. I also set up up a variable so the user can save to their local storage. I finished by adding some css using bootstrap.
